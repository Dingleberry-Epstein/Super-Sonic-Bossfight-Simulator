# Sonic the Hedgehog in Pygame.
This is a simple attempt at making a working Sonic game using Pygame. I've tried getting angled movement to work but it's actually quite troublesome.
My tip to you is to use another engine for a Sonic game, preferably Godot or Gamemaker if you're a beginner, however if you insist on using Pygame, remember to use pygame.mask instead of pygame.rect.
I don't really care much about what happens to my code so feel free to use any of it, but please, **credit me if you do use any of it!**
