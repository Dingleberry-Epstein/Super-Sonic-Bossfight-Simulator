# Sonic the Hedgehog in Pygame.
This is a simple attempt at making a working Sonic game using Pygame. I've tried getting angled movement to work but it's actually quite troublesome. The angles did work to some extent but it was incredibly buggy and just not worth it, so I am using Pygame.rect instead of pygame.mask for hitboxes.
My tip to you is to use another engine for a Sonic game, preferably Godot or Gamemaker if you're a beginner, however if you insist on using Pygame, remember to use pygame.mask instead of traditional hitboxes with pygame.Rect.

I don't really care much about what happens to my code so feel free to use any of it, but please,
